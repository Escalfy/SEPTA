Side Effect Prediction Timely Analysis 

Web Application Prototype 

To what extent are machine learning adverse-drug event classifiers actionable by clinical physicians? 

The aim was to develop a proof of concept (PoC) that identifies how predictive ADE classifiers can be of practical value to take action by clinical physicians. Taking action to report ADEs by aiming to facilitate the process required satisfying conditions: 

•	Articulate needs of physicians during ADE reporting 

•	Design an interactive artefact prototype to make ADE classifiers actionable.

•	Qualitatively evaluate the artefact to address feasibility in clinical settings.


Taking a human-centred approach to machine learning in view of improving clinical patient safety is unprecedented.
