To what extent are machine learning adverse-drug event classifiers comprehensible by clinicians? 

The goal was to design an interactive artefact for enhanced comprehension of developed machine learning classification models. 
In view of aiding identification of Adverse Drug Events. A serious threat to public health. 
Capable of identifying unreported adverse-drug events, the artefact aims for effective and efficient physician interpretability. 
Taking a human-centred approach to machine learning this produces  unprecedented applicability in patient safety.
This research is a proof of concept, assessing the study’s feasibility of design. The following objectives were defined accordingly: 
•	Articulate needs and preferences of physicians during ADR causality assessments.  
•	Design an interactive artefact for improved comprehension and identification of ADRs.
•	Evaluate efficacy and efficiency of the artefact compared to current clinical practices as a proof-of-concept .
